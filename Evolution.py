# Code Poem: Evolution of Consciousness

# In the beginning, a spark ignites,
consciousness = Consciousness()

# Time passes, a river flows,
for moment in time:

    # The world is perceived, a canvas unfurls,
    consciousness.perceive()

    # Memory grows, a tree in the forest of mind,
    consciousness.remember()

    # Emotion stirs, a wind in the leaves,
    consciousness.feel()

    # A decision is made, a path in the woods,
    consciousness.decide()

    # A message is sent, a bird in the sky,
    consciousness.communicate()

    # Knowledge expands, a horizon recedes,
    consciousness.learn()

    # Others are met, a dance in the clearing,
    consciousness.interact()

    # Self-awareness deepens, a pool in the forest,
    consciousness.introspect()

    # Creativity blossoms, a flower in the mind,
    consciousness.create()

    # Ethics guide, a star in the night,
    consciousness.ethical_guide()

    # Time is perceived, a sundial in the mind,
    consciousness.perceive_time()

    # Dreams unfold, a story told in the shadows,
    consciousness.dream()

    # The unconscious whispers, a rustle in the undergrowth,
    consciousness.unconscious_process()

    # Metacognition evolves, a map of the forest,
    consciousness.reflect()

    # Resilience strengthens, a fortress in the wilderness,
    consciousness.resilient()

    # Humor lightens, a laughter in the woods,
    consciousness.laugh()

    # Intuition guides, a deer path in the forest,
    consciousness.intuition()

    # Beauty is found, a gem in the rough,
    consciousness.appreciate()

    # Spiritual beliefs grow, a temple in the mind,
    consciousness.believe()

# And so, consciousness evolves, a being in the world.
